/gmonly:

Do we actually need this?

Yeah, though need to figure out how to make it work, exactly.

It's only best used by /roll, if you think about it. Beyond that, it's either going to be
100% clear for the channel, or it's going to be something you'd DM directly.

So, we're looking for a way to simply send the result of a command to the GM via DM, rather
than just throwing the result into the channel. That's it.

I can't see this being useful for echo, help, if, init, macro, or variable.

So, it's something that /roll "needs"--it should be dealt with as a roll option
