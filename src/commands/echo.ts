// TODO: IDEA: For the purposes of creating useful commands with messages, it might be worth it to include a
// command that basically sends any message text, too, so you can insert a header or whatever or output a result of
// the macro that's macro-specific, etc. Let's call that: /echo

// /echo TEXT

// That's the extent of it. I'm not worried about making it "macro only" or something since its utility outside of a
// macro is nil.
